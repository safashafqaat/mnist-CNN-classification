# MNIST CNN Classification

This project demonstrates a simple **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset**.

---

##  Features
- Load and preprocess MNIST dataset  
- Build a CNN model with PyTorch  
- Train the model with Adam optimizer  
- Track training/validation loss and accuracy  
- Visualize results with plots  
- Scatter plot of correct vs incorrect predictions (using PCA for dimensionality reduction)
